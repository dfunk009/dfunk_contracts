## About the contract

This is a smart contract for distribution of funds from the community pool as per [Prop 4080 on Terra Classic](https://classic-agora.terra.money/t/proposal-distribute-50-transaction-fees-to-the-community-pool-increase-proposer-validator-rewards/44729)

## Distribution logic

Consider a total transaction fee (TF) of 100 LUNC. The distribution logic is as follows:

- Amount going to the community pool (CP) = 50 LUNC (50% of TF)
- Burn amount (BA) = 35 LUNC (35% of TF or `70%` of CP)
- Airdrop amount for dapps (AA) = 10 LUNC (10% of TF or `20%` of CP)
- Amount distributed for classic core development (CD) = 5 LUNC (5% of TF or `10%` of CP)

**The contract will only handle the distribution of the Burn Amount (BA), Airdrop Amount (AA) and Core Development Amount (CD) in the ratio of `70:20:10`.**

## Burn address

The burn amount will be sent to the following address: 
```
terra1sk06e3dyexuq4shw77y3dsv480xv42mq73anxu
```
## Classic Core Developer address

The classic core development is currently being handled by Terra Rebels that have their [multi-sig wallet](https://www.terrarebels.net/donate) at the following address: 
```
terra1067mhg3qwdccep2sp95cca8nmj8ds395w2rue7
```

## Airdrop whitelist
If you are a Terra Classic dapp with a [TVL greater than 0](https://defillama.com/chain/Terra%20Classic), you can create a pull request [here](whitelist/airdrop.json) to qualify for the airdrop.

## Usage

You can interact with this smart contract using this **CLASSIC MAINNET** address:
```
terra1wy2zdqqs34hcdpmyqcfmnvxrje60m8z2xax5l7
```
The contract has been instantiated without the `--set-signer-as-admin` flag, making it immutable (the contract cannot be migrated).

## ExecuteMsg

### Distribute
The following messages need to be sent to distribute the funds from the contract.

To distribute LUNC:
```
{"distribute":{"denom":"uluna"}}
```
To distribute USTC:
```
{"distribute":{"denom":"uusd"}}
```
### Burn The Bottom

After the `Distribute` Msg is called, a tiny amount of LUNC/USTC (less than 1 LUNC/USTC), may be left behind in the contract due to floating point calculations. This tiny amount (less than 1 LUNC/USTC) can be burned using the following messages:

LUNC:
```
{"burn_the_bottom":{"denom":"uluna"}}
```
USTC:
```
{"burn_the_bottom":{"denom":"uusd"}}
```
Note: `Burn The Bottom` will only work if the contract balance is less than 1 LUNC or 1 USTC, and will throw an error if the contract balance is above 1 LUNC / 1 USTC.

### UpdateConfig

Config can be updated only by the admin set via `InstantiateMsg`. The administration of the contract is transferable to another account, a multisig wallet, or a governance contract. Setting the `admin` field as empty will make the contract non-updatable.
